# Planned revisions to the reproduction of Chakraborty (2021)

Author: Andrey (Andy) Cao

## Analysis

My modifications to this reproducibility study of Chakraborty (2021) will focus on improving cohesiveness and clarity of the discussion and conclusion sections as well as small changes to figures and tables to improve formatting and design choice. 

To improve the discussion and conclusion sections, I will be adjusting the position of the "rationale for the updated report," integrating Emily's discussion and new results, and separating the conclusions into their own section.
These changes will improve the structure of the report and give those producing future reproductions of this study a clearer understanding of the results and significance of the study. 
Additionally, the inclusion of new results into the discussion question will provide the most updated information for future reproductions of this study. 

The minor changes to figures will include adjustments to the final choropleth map as well as improving the formatting of the 'missing data' table.
Both of these changes will better the readability of the report by creating a more visually understandable map figure and formatting a table for HTML view. 

## Results

The improvements to the study's discussion and conclusion sections will manifest a more structured and simple organization. 
  The discussion section will be placed after the last code block and integrate older discussion material (such as Emily's) with the newer results.
  The following conclusion section will discuss whether the reproduction of the study was successful and the implications of the original study to general scientific knowledge. 
  Lastly, the "rationale for the updated report" will be placed at the very end of the study and will explain changes made to the original study for the reproduction. 

The improvements to the figure and table will manifest in a direct change in the said figure and table. 
  The choropleth map will have an improved color gradient utilizing a full-color ramp.
  The 'missing data' table will fit into the screen when viewed in HTML format. 

## Discussion

If the revised discussion/conclusion sections feature three clearly written and defined sections (discussion, conclusion, and rationale), then the sections and their organization will have been improved for clarity.
If the choropleth map showcases an improved color scheme and the formatting of the 'missing data' table fits into the HTML format, then the figure and table will have improved clarity for future reproductions of this study.


## Revision (2023-12-17)
When originally writing the preanalysis plan for this reproduction, I failed to include some of my additions to the study.
In order to keep the integrity of my original preanalysis, I will explain my additions to the study as a revision to improve my report narrative while still maintaining transparency.

Along with the suggested revisions to the Chakraborty (2021) study, I will also add two map visualizations showcasing the Black population with disability and the Hispanic non-White population with disability. 
As a result, the visualizations should help showcase how the two variables play a significant role in the GEE model and may highlight demographic patterns throughout regions of the country. 
The addition of the map visualizations should improve the reproduction's clarity surrounding the study's variables.
