# Planned revisions to reproduction of Chakraborty (2021)

Author: Andrey (Andy), Cao

## Analysis

My modifications to this reproducibility study of Chakraborty (2021) will focus on improving cohesiveness and clarity of the discussion and conclusion sections as well as small changes to figures and tables to improve formatting and design choice. 

To improve the discussion and conclusion sections, I will be adjusting the position of the "rationale for the updated report," integrating Emily's discussion and new results, and separating the conclusions into their own section.
These changes will improve the structure of the report and give those producing future reproductions of this study a more clearer understanding of the results and significance of the study. 
Additionally, the inclusion of new results into the discussion question will provide the most updated information for future reproductions of this study. 

The minor changes to figures will include adjustments to the final choropleth map as well as improving formatting of the 'missing data' table.
Both of these changes will better the readability of the report by creating a more visually understandable map figure and formatting a table for html view. 

## Results

The improvements to the discussion and conclusion sections of the study will manifest and a more structured and simple organization. 
  The discussion section will be placed after the last code block and will integrate both older discussion material (such as Emily's) with the newer results.
  The following conclusion section will discuss whether the reproduction of the study was successful and the implications of the original study to general scientific knowledge. 
  Lastly, the "rationale for the updated report" will be placed at the very end of the study and will explain changes made to the original study for the reproduction. 

The improvements to the figure and table will manifest in a direct change in the said figure and table. 
  The choropleth map will have a improved color gradient utilizing a full color ramp.
  The 'missing data' table will fit into the screen when viewing in html format. 

## Discussion

If the revised discussion/conclusion sections features three clearly written and defined sections (discussion, conclusion, and rationale), then the sections and their organization will have been improved for clarity.
If the choropleth map showcases an improved color scheme and the formatting of the 'missing data' table fits into the html format, then the figure and table will have improved in clarity for future reproductions of this study.
